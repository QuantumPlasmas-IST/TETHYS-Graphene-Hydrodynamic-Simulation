@section intro Introduction

TETHYS software, now on its version 2.3.1, is hastily reaching the first point of maturity. Having passed roughly two years in the development of both the analytical models and the source code, it is now a reliable and robust software although yet incomplete. With the prospect of a new widening of the team working for the development of this endeavour, and with the expectancy of a public release in the near future, the creation of a user's and developer's manual is of the utmost importance. However, as a research project, TETHYS source code is ever-changing and so keeping this manual up-to-date is a considerable effort that we wish that the reader may appreciate.

This small manual is intended to be a first and broad guide to the usage of TETHYS code, therefore the introduction on the physical model and numerical methods found in this chapter are but a general description aiming to get the reader acquainted with the terms used and approaches to the problem that we have followed. For a more thorough study of the physics and computational or mathematical concepts the reader will find a concise bibliography at the end of this manual and whenever any question, suggestion or commentary arise we urge the reader to send them to pedro.cosme.e.silva@tecnico.ulisboa.pt


@section required Requirements

* gcc compiler

* cmake (version 3.16)

  To generate the makefiles

* OpenMP<sup>&reg;</sup>

  Responsible for CPU parallelization.

* HDF5<sup>&reg;</sup> libraries (version 1.8.20 or higher)

  For the writing of the complete data.


@section use Usage
@subsection compile Compilation
For the compilation of the source code a makefile can ge automatically generated with cmake. It is generally a sensible idea to create an empty directory to hold the executable files

```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
And then, for the compilation itself.
```console
$ cmake ..
$ make all
```
@subsection run Running a simulation


To run a simulation one can simply invoke
```console
$ ./TETHYS_2D 
```
and the program will prompt the user to provide the necessary parameters for the simulation. Alternatively, the user can pass directly such parameters as command arguments.
The necessary inputs are:
* Sound velocity S (vel_snd)
* Fermi velocity v<sub>F</sub> (vel_fer)
* Collision, of the electrons with impurities or defects, frequency (col)
* Shear viscosity (vis)
* Cyclotron frequency (cyc)
* (save_mode)

and optionally:

* Aspect ratio of the simulation grid x:y (aspect_ratio)

```console
$ ./TETHYS_2D vel_snd vel_fer col vis cyc save_mode aspect_ratio
```
