  <small>For generating the documentation</small>

* Gnuplot & Python

  <small>For the plotting</small>
  
## Usage   
### Compilation
For the compilation of the source code a makefile can ge automatically generated with cmake. It is generally a sensible idea to create an empty directory to hold the executable files

```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
And then, for the compilation itself. 
```console
$ cmake ..
$ make all
```

### Running a simulation
#### 1) Fluid simulation
To run a simulation one can simply invoke
```console
$ ./TETHYS_2D 
```
and the program will prompt the user to provide the necessary parameters for the simulation.
The necessary inputs are:
* Sound velocity S (vel_snd)
* Fermi velocity v<sub>F</sub> (vel_fer)
* Collision, of the electrons with impurities or defects, frequency (col)
* Shear viscosity (vis)
* Odd viscosity (odd)
* Cyclotron frequency (cyc)
* Thermal diffusivity (therm)
* Saving option (save_mode)
and optionally:  
* Aspect ratio of the simulation grid x:y (aspect_ratio)

Alternatively, the user can pass directly such parameters as command arguments with 
```console
$ ./TETHYS_2D vel_snd vel_fer col vis odd cyc therm save_mode aspect_ratio
```
Moreover, the parameters can also be passed via a `.ini` file 
```console
$ ./TETHYS_2D parameters.ini
```
As standard with .ini files sections can be indicated by square brackets as in [section] and comment lines start with a semicolon ; The readble keywords are

| Keywords | Parameter |   |
| ----: | :----: | :---: |
|  sound   | Sound velocity     |  _S_     |
|  fermi   | Fermi velocity     | _v<sub>0</sub>_     |
|  shear   | Shear viscosity     |  _&nu;<sub>s</sub>_    |
|  odd   |  Odd/Hall viscosity    | _&nu;<sub>o</sub>_     |
|  col   |  Collision frequency    |  1/_&tau;_     |
|  cycl   |  Cyclotron frequency    | _&omega;<sub>c</sub>_     |
|  therm   |  Thermal diffusivity    |  _&alpha;_|
|  aspect   |  Aspect ratio    |  _AR_     |
|  time   |  Simulation time    |  _T<sub>max</sub>_     |
|  save   |  Save mode    | -    |

#### 2) Electrical response 
To later extract the electronic quantities from the fluid simulation data one should run

```console
$ ./TETHYS_ELEC_2D [name of output file].h5
```


### Output description

The user can opt for simplified or full output.

In the simplified version the output is a data file named ``preview_2D<...>.dat`` organised by tab separated columns with the (normalised) values of time, density at x=L, x component of velocity  at x=L , density  at x=0 and x component of velocity  at x=0 (by this order).

The full output option will return a HDF5 file, ``hdf5_2D<...>.h5``, with the data of density, both velocity components and temperature, besides all the relevant simulation parameters saved as attributes of the file. Each HDF5 file has a root group called Data that houses the simulation attributes as well as the groups Density, VelocityX, VelocityY and Temperature, inside each of these three groups the simulation results are stored for each temporal snapshot, organised in a matricial form.

### Semantic Versioning

Standard form of numeric *major.minor.patch* starting with the initial commit 1.0.0. Small (but relevant) bugs are considered lower level patches and new features (such as updating physical model) are minor level. Major level versions should be saved for breaking updates (like 2D implementation or parallelization)
